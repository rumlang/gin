Functional language, easily extensible and possible (Lua features with LISP syntax and functional) to be embarked on software Go!

## History

Idealized in GopherCon Brasil 2017 (reason of the language being written in Go), had the purpose of being virtual machine of CLISP (development for fun and the founder team enjoys functional programming), after seeing that there was already some parser of CLISP written in Go we had a initiative to make a language with syntax like CLISP but with some own paradigms (such as asynchronous processing using goroutine underneath, thus joining what we have best in the Go).

### Why Rum?

As the language was born in Canasvieiras (Florian√≥polis - Brazil) neighborhood in the seaside frequented by tourists having the pirate boat as a tourist attraction, we decided to give the name of the typical beverage of pirates for the language.

### Why another lisp?

## Install

```
go install github.com/rumlang/rum
```

## Run

```
rum
```

or

```
go run rum.go
```

## Proposal syntax

```
(package "main"
  ; load file on this code
  (load lerolero) ; ./lerolero.rum

  ; import package lerolero and used methods
  (import test lerolero.test) ; ./lerolero/test.rum
  (print (test.Test))

  ; set lets
  (let a 1)
  (print (a))

  ; create function
  (def hi()
    "Hello")
  (print hi)

  ; create function (by lambda)
  (let area
    (lambda (r) (* 3.141592653 (* r r))))
  (print (area 10.0))

  ; create loops with for
  (for (print "hello")) ; will loop while expression or function return false
  (for area (10.0 20.0 30.0)) ; will interact on the list elements
  (for (let a 1)
    (== a 10)
      (let a (+ a 1)
      (print a)))

  ; create if
  (if (== a 10)       ; if a is equal to 10
    (print "Hello"))  ; print Hello

  (if (== a "good")   ; if a is equal to "good"
    (print "good")    ; print "good"
    (print 'bad))     ; otherwise print "bad"

  (if (== a "good")   ; if a is equal to "good"
    (print "good")    ; print "good"
    (if (== a "bad")  ; if not and is equal to "bad"
      (print "bad")   ; print "bad"
      (print "ugly")) ; otherwise print "ugly"

```

## Using rum as a Go package

### Install

```
go get github.com/rumlang/rum
```

### Example

```golang
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"strings"

	"github.com/rumlang/rum"
)

func main() {
	const input = `
(package main
  (print 'Hello)
)
`
	s := bufio.NewScanner(strings.NewReader(input))
	vm := rum.New()
	err := vm.Run(s)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}
}
```
